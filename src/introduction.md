# Introduction

Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.

It's a popular choice for designing systems with high-performance requirements, such as gaming engines, databases, or operating systems, and it's an ideal choice for creating a common module for several platforms, including web, iOS, and Android.

We will build a rust library in this series and port it to different platforms. We are calling it `libexa` (which stands for Example Library ðŸ«£).

I strongly recommend [installing all of your Rust toolchains using rustup.][1]
